<p>Working with Magento on a daily basis as a shop owner, webmaster or developer is standard practice. But do you ever monitor Magento on a daily or hourly basis?</p>
<p>Do you know whatâ€™s going on in your shop, and how customers like the shopping experience? Do you get triggered when something is wrong? Did someone clear the cache? If so, when? Is Redis having issues? Have new CMS pages been created? What is the load time for your users? Why is CPU/MEM that high? And is there a relation between all of this?</p>
<p>All of these things are happening on a real time basis right now. Get in control of your own shop and manage IT!</p>
<p>During Meet Magento Switserland Ray Bogman presented a business case from a well-known Magento shop in the Netherlands (www.condoom-anoniem.nl), and explain how the shop owner monitors what is happening in his shop in real time.</p>
