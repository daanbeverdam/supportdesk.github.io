<p>It's almost time! From <u>3-5 April</u>, the annual <a href="https://imagine.magento.com/" target="_blank" title="Magento Imagine 2017">Magento Imagine 2017</a>- "Powering Tomorrow" event will be taking place. The biggest <strong>Magento</strong> event in the world will be organized in the <strong>Wynn hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas</strong>. Over <u>2500 Magento commerce experts,</u> from more than <u>45 countries</u> will get together to get inspired, getting familiar with the latest technologies and developments, and of course to have fun!</p>
<h3>Road to Imagine</h3>
<p>And with the<u> biggest Magento event</u> in the world coming up, we as Magento fanatics, <strong>SupportDesk</strong> had to attend. That's why we send <a href="https://twitter.com/raybogman" target="_blank" title="ray bogman">Ray Bogman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vkerkhoff" target="_blank" title="Vladimir Kerkhoff">Vladimir Kerkhoff</a> for the whole week to <strong>Los Angeles</strong> and <strong>Las vegas</strong> to get the <strong>Imagine 2017 Experience</strong>. Before the event starts in Vegas, there is a lot of <strong>Magento</strong> to experience in LA. So today<strong> Ray</strong> and <strong>Vladimir</strong> started will all kinds of "Road to Imagine" activities. <br><br>These included both educational and sporting activities with other Magento enthusiasts. The day started at 05:00 with a 5k warming-up run as their preparation for the “<a href="https://www.wagento.com/happenings/big-dam-run" target="_blank" title="big dam run">Big Dam Run</a>” <u>Sunday, April 2nd.</u> After, they went to de <strong>Magento Headquarters</strong> to meet the people who are going to ride the whole <strong>“RoadToImagine”</strong> by bike . A 600 mile journey from LA to Las Vegas. Starting this morning at 07:00.</p>
<h3>OroCommerce, OroCRM, OroPlafform</h3>
<p>After Meeting the team and wishing them good luck, Ray went on to the headquarters of <strong>ORO Inc</strong> for an inspiring talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/YoavKutner" target="_blank" title="Yoav Kutner">Yoav Kutner</a><strong> (Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Oro Inc)</strong> and<a href="https://twitter.com/dmitriysoroka" target="_blank" title="Dima Soroka"> Dima Soroka</a> (<strong>CTO at ORO Inc</strong>). He got new insights on how Oro sees itself in the near future and how the <strong>B2B</strong> market is growing in Europe, particular Germany. With that in mind we also got a glimpse at the new <strong>Marello</strong><strong>ERP</strong> software, made by <strong>Madia</strong> in the Netherlands. It’s a new <strong>CRM software solution</strong> that is meeting retail needs and boosting business and makes the integration of <strong>OroCommerce</strong> and <strong>B2B</strong> easier. With the new <strong>Enterprise</strong> environment of <strong>OroCommerce</strong> it should be a perfect fit for the current and future market developments. We closed the session with a demo about the <strong>Oro Cloud edition</strong>, which is completely set up and managed internally with<strong> Oro’s</strong> own s<u>ystem and patch management</u>. The service can be scaled up to large sizes and hopefully will come to<strong> Europe</strong> soon.</p>

<p>In order to sell your extension in the <strong>Magento Marketplace</strong>, it must first pass the <strong>Extension Quality Program</strong> (EQP).
